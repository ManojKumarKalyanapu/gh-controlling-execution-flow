What is Conditional Execution?
In GitHub Actions, you can control when a workflow, job, or step should run based on specific conditions, such as:

1.Branch name
2.Commit message
3.Environment
4.Previous job success
5.Manual inputs

1. Workflow-Level Conditions
Not supported directly with if:
Instead, use event filters like branches, tags, and paths:
example:
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
Use case: Trigger only when pushing to main or updating certain files.

2. Job-Level Conditions
Use the if: key under a job to control whether the job runs or not.
example:
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests on main branch"

3. Step-Level Conditions
You can apply if: at the step level too.
example:
steps:
  - name: Run only if previous step succeeded
    if: success()
    run: echo "This runs if previous step was successful"

  - name: Run only on pull requests
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    run: echo "This is a PR"


Common Conditions & Expressions
| Condition           | Description                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `success()`         | True if all previous steps/jobs succeeded |
| `failure()`         | True if any previous step/job failed      |
| `always()`          | Always runs the step/job                  |
| `cancelled()`       | True if workflow was cancelled            |
| `github.ref`        | The branch or tag ref                     |
| `github.event_name` | The event that triggered the workflow     |
| `github.actor`      | The user who triggered the workflow       |
| `contains()`        | Checks if a string contains a substring   |


Example: Conditional Job Based on Input
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      deploy:
        type: boolean
        default: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: ${{ github.event.inputs.deploy == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying app..."


Job Dependency Condition (needs + if):
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Build complete"

  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: success() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying build"

Best Practices:
| Tip                                                  | Why it helps                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Use `if:` at job level for skipping entire jobs      | Saves time and resources                            |
| Use `success()` and `failure()` wisely               | Ensures logical flow                                |
| Don't rely on just `branches` — use `github.ref` too | More flexible condition logic                       |
| Test conditions with debug output                    | Use `echo` and `env` variables to debug expressions |

Summary:
| Level    | Conditional Support | Syntax             | Example               |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Workflow | Event filters only  | `on.push.branches` | Run only on `main`    |
| Job      | ✅ Yes               | `if: condition`    | Run only if `main`    |
| Step     | ✅ Yes               | `if: condition`    | Run if PR, fail, etc. |
