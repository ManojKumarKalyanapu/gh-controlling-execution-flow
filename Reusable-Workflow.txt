What is a Reusable Workflow?
A reusable workflow is a workflow file that can be called by other workflows — either:
In the same repository, or
From a different repository

Great for:
DRY principles (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
Shared CI/CD logic
Deployment workflows
Security scans
Testing matrices

File Structure
Reusable workflows must be defined under:
.github/workflows/reusable.yml

How to Define a Reusable Workflow
Use workflow_call as the trigger in the reusable workflow:
# .github/workflows/reusable.yml
name: Reusable Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      username:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET:
        required: true

jobs:
  echo-user:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello, ${{ inputs.username }}"
      - run: echo "Secret: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}"


How to Call a Reusable Workflow
From another workflow in the same or different repo:

# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: Caller Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  use-reusable:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
    with:
      username: Manoj
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}


Supported Inputs and Secrets
inputs: Accepts strings, booleans, numbers

secrets: Must be explicitly passed from caller workflow

Reusable Workflow Limitations
| Limitation                              | Description                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger only on `workflow_call`         | Can’t run standalone                         |
| Cannot define matrix in called workflow | Must pass matrix from caller                 |
| Secrets must be explicitly passed       | No auto-inheritance                          |
| Limited to same repo or public repos    | Private cross-repo usage needs access rights |


Best Practices
| Tip                                          | Reason                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Keep it generic                              | Allows reuse across multiple projects |
| Validate inputs                              | Prevents runtime errors               |
| Version reusable workflows using tags or SHA | Ensures stable builds                 |
| Combine with `strategy.matrix`               | For powerful CI workflows             |

Summary
| Feature         | Syntax / Example                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Define reusable | `on: workflow_call`                              |
| Call local      | `uses: ./.github/workflows/file.yml`             |
| Call remote     | `uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/file.yml@main` |
| Pass inputs     | `with:` + `inputs:`                              |
| Pass secrets    | `secrets:`                                       |
